# Drum-Kit-Website

Crafted an interactive drum kit application with fundamental HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, utilizing JSON to map sounds to corresponding drum images.

This project enables users to create rhythmic beats by clicking on drum images or using keyboard shortcuts like "w," "a," "s," "d," "j," "k," and "l." It provides an engaging and enjoyable musical experience for users of all skill levels.
